"143","thomas"," There's some cedar-lined cupboards in the attics for things that aren't often worn, travelling clothes and such. Mr Watson used them to rotate the summer and winter stuff; I'll show you later.",21,"01x01 - Episode One",143
"144","mr bates"," What about studs and links? Do I choose them, or does he?",21,"01x01 - Episode One",144
"145","thomas"," Lay them out unless he asks for something in particular. These for a ball, these for an ordinary dinner, these only in London.",21,"01x01 - Episode One",145

"156","mrs hughes"," Is this a public holiday no one's told me of?",22,"01x01 - Episode One",156
"157","robert, earl of grantham"," She was certainly reluctant to go into mourning.",23,"01x01 - Episode One",157
"158","cora, countess of grantham"," Well, she'll have to; we all will. O'Brien's sorting out my black now, and I've told Anna to see what the girls have that still fits. Of course, this alters everything. You won't try to deny it. You must challenge the entail now, surely?",23,"01x01 - Episode One",158
"159","robert, earl of grantham"," Can't we at least wait until we know they're dead before we discuss it?",23,"01x01 - Episode One",159

"177","cora, countess of grantham"," We were all so fond of him.",24,"01x01 - Episode One",177

"187","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," My dear, I didn't come here to fight. Lord Grantham wanted to protect the estate. It never occurred to him that you wouldn't have a son.",24,"01x01 - Episode One",187
"188","cora, countess of grantham"," Well, I didn't.",24,"01x01 - Episode One",188
"189","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," No...you did not. But when Patrick had married Mary, and you grandson been hailed as master, honour would have been satisfied. Unfortunately, now...",24,"01x01 - Episode One",189
"190","cora, countess of grantham"," Now a complete unknown has the right to pocket my money, along with the rest of the swag.",24,"01x01 - Episode One",190
"191","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," The problem is, saving your dowry would break up the estate. It would be the ruin of everything Robert's given his life to.",24,"01x01 - Episode One",191
"192","cora, countess of grantham"," And he knows this?",24,"01x01 - Episode One",192
"193","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," Well, if he doesn't, he will.",24,"01x01 - Episode One",193
"194","cora, countess of grantham"," Then there's no answer.",24,"01x01 - Episode One",194
"195","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," Yes, there is, and it's a simple one. The entail must be smashed in its entirety, and Mary recognized as heiress of all.",24,"01x01 - Episode One",195
"196","cora, countess of grantham"," There's nothing we can do about the title.",24,"01x01 - Episode One",196
"197","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," No. She can't have the title. But she can have your money. And the estate. I didn't run Downton for thirty years to see it go lock, stock, and barrel to a stranger from God knows where.",24,"01x01 - Episode One",197
"198","cora, countess of grantham"," Are we to be friends, then?",24,"01x01 - Episode One",198

"215","daisy mason"," What is it?",25,"01x01 - Episode One",215
"216","mrs patmore"," Salt of sorrel. I asked him for some to clean the brass pots. So, put it somewhere careful; it's poison.",25,"01x01 - Episode One",216

"309","mr bates"," Oh, it's only the old wound. After I left the army, I had a spot of bother and just when I got through that, about a year ago my knee started playing up. A bit of shrapnel got left in or something had moved, but it's fine. It's not a problem.",34,"01x01 - Episode One",309

"346","thomas"," Not lazy...exactly. But he just can't carry. He can hardly manage His Lordship's cases. You saw how it was when they went out to London for the memorial. He can't help with the guest luggage neither, and as for waiting a table, we can forget that.",38,"01x01 - Episode One",346

"1114","mr bates"," I said they shouldn't have let both footmen go.",34,"01x02 - Episode Two",381

"1165","anna bates"," Would you like us to go, Mr Carson?",37,"01x02 - Episode Two",432
"1166","mr carson"," No. You know it now. You might as well bear witness to my shame. He turned up in the village with no warning some days ago on the run, asking for somewhere to hide and, of course, for money.",37,"01x02 - Episode Two",433

"1171","charles grigg"," You did not.",37,"01x02 - Episode Two",438
"1172","mr carson"," I put him in an empty cottage and fed him from the kitchens. I couldn't buy food in the village, it would raise too many questions. I stole. I'm a thief. She...saw it.",37,"01x02 - Episode Two",439

"1681","anna bates"," Well, could we manage it between us?",27,"01x03 - Episode Three",359
"1682","lady mary"," He weighs a ton. I can hardly shift him at all. We'll need at least one other. What about Bates?",27,"01x03 - Episode Three",360
"1683","anna bates"," He couldn't lift him. William can't keep a secret, and Thomas wouldn't try to.",27,"01x03 - Episode Three",361
"1684","lady mary"," We've got to do something!",27,"01x03 - Episode Three",362

"1694","cora, countess of grantham"," I couldn't. It's not possible.",28,"01x03 - Episode Three",372
"1695","lady mary"," If you don't, we will figure in a scandal of such magnitude it will never be forgotten until long after we're both dead. I'll be ruined, Mama! Ruined and notorious, a laughingstock, a social pariah. Is that what you want for your eldest daughter? Is it what you want for the family?",28,"01x03 - Episode Three",373
"1696","cora, countess of grantham"," We must cover him up.",28,"01x03 - Episode Three",374

"1705","cora, countess of grantham"," I feel now that I can never forgive what you have put me through this night. I hope in time I will come to be more merciful, but I doubt it.",30,"01x03 - Episode Three",383
"1706","lady mary"," You won't tell Papa?",30,"01x03 - Episode Three",384
"1707","cora, countess of grantham"," Since it would probably kill him, and certainly ruin his life, I will not. But I keep this secret for his sake, not for yours.",30,"01x03 - Episode Three",385
"1708","lady mary"," Yes, Mama.",30,"01x03 - Episode Three",386
"1709","cora, countess of grantham"," Anna, I will not insult you by asking that you also conceal Lady Mary's shame. Let us go.",30,"01x03 - Episode Three",387

"1711","lady mary"," Yes.",32,"01x03 - Episode Three",389
"1712","evelyn napier"," Terrible thing. Awful. Ghastly for your parents. I don't suppose I shall ever make it up to them.",32,"01x03 - Episode Three",390
"1713","lady mary"," It wasn't your fault.",32,"01x03 - Episode Three",391

"1717","evelyn napier"," Of course.",32,"01x03 - Episode Three",395

"1723","evelyn napier"," Which obviously you did.",32,"01x03 - Episode Three",401
"1724","william"," I had an uncle who went like that. Finished his cocoa, closed his book and fell back dead on the pillow.",33,"01x03 - Episode Three",402
"1725","thomas"," I don't think Mr Pamuk bothered with cocoa much, or books. He had other interests.",33,"01x03 - Episode Three",403

"1738","gwen"," And you don't mind?",33,"01x03 - Episode Three",416
"1739","lady sybil"," Why should I? I think it's terrific that people make their own lives, especially women. Write to them today and name me as your reference. I can give it without ever specifying precisely what your work here has been.",33,"01x03 - Episode Three",417
"1740","gwen"," Milady...thank you.",33,"01x03 - Episode Three",418

"1744","cora, countess of grantham"," Will we be seeing you here again?",34,"01x03 - Episode Three",422
"1745","evelyn napier"," Nothing would give me more pleasure, but I'm afraid I'm a little busy at the moment, and...I wonder if I might risk embarrassing you, because I should like to make myself clear. The truth is, Lady Grantham, I'm not a vain man. I do not consider myself a very interesting person, but I feel it's important that my future wife should think me so. A woman who finds me boring could never love me, and I believe marriage should be based on love. (chuckles) At least at the start.",34,"01x03 - Episode Three",423
"1746","cora, countess of grantham"," Thank you for your faith in me, Mr Napier. Your instincts do you credit. Good luck to you.",34,"01x03 - Episode Three",424

"1752","mr carson"," Well, you know. He was a handsome stranger from foreign parts one minute, and the next he was as dead as a doornail. It's bound to be a shock.",35,"01x03 - Episode Three",430
"1753","robert, earl of grantham"," Of course. Upstairs or down. It's been horrid for the ladies, and for the female staff, I expect.",35,"01x03 - Episode Three",431
"1754","mr carson"," It's particularly hard on the younger maids.",35,"01x03 - Episode Three",432
"1755","robert, earl of grantham"," Indeed. Don't let the footmen be too coarse in front of them. Thomas likes to show off, but we must have a care for feminine sensibilities. They are finer and more fragile than our own.",35,"01x03 - Episode Three",433

"1764","lady mary"," Don't be ridiculous.",37,"01x03 - Episode Three",442
"1765","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," I'm not being ridiculous. No Englishman would dream of dying in someone else's house. Especially someone they didn't even know.",37,"01x03 - Episode Three",443

I must strive to be worthy of the task I've been set. If I could take Mama's out of the estate, Downton would have to be sold to pay for it. Is that what you want?

"3353","mr carson"," That is correct.",48,"01x06 - Episode Six",478
"3354","mr bates"," And you are right, there is no truth in them. But if you were to proceed with the matter, you would find them to be proven. Thomas has tried to convince you that I am a drunkard and a thief.",48,"01x06 - Episode Six",479
"3355","anna bates"," Which we never believed.",48,"01x06 - Episode Six",480
"3356","mr bates"," Because you know no different. Until a couple of years ago, I was a drunkard...and I was imprisoned as a thief.",48,"01x06 - Episode Six",481
"3357","mr bates"," I have repaid your kindness very poorly. I masqueraded as a man of honour and integrity, but by any moral code, I am disgraced.",48,"01x06 - Episode Six",482
"3358","mrs hughes"," That can't be the whole story.",48,"01x06 - Episode Six",483

"3361","mr bates"," No, but I feel I have no choice.",48,"01x06 - Episode Six",486
"3362","mr carson"," You owe me a say in the matter, surely?",48,"01x06 - Episode Six",487
"3363","mr bates"," If you wish.",48,"01x06 - Episode Six",488
"3364","mr carson"," Then I will consider the case and give you my decision when I have discussed it with His Lordship. Until then, I hope you will remain in your post.",48,"01x06 - Episode Six",489

"3639","mr bates"," His delay is generous.",19,"01x07 - Episode Seven",176
"3640","mr carson"," However, it will be no surprise to you that Miss O'Brien has been unwilling to let things drop. It seems that, when we were in London, she made a new friend. A lady's maid in the house of a colonel in your former regiment.",19,"01x07 - Episode Seven",177

"3650","lady rosamund"," Exactly. So ask Matthew to wait until the child is born. If it's a girl you can wed him happily, and all will be as it was before.",20,"01x07 - Episode Seven",187
"3651","lady mary"," But if I delay, won't he think I'm only after him for his position? Besides, I'm not sure I want to put him off, even without the title.",20,"01x07 - Episode Seven",188
"3652","lady mary"," We get on so well, you know. And he's terribly clever. He might end up Lord Chancellor.",20,"01x07 - Episode Seven",189
"3653","lady rosamund"," And he might not. Oh, come along, Mary, be sensible. Can you really see yourself dawdling your life away as the wife of a...country solicitor?",20,"01x07 - Episode Seven",190
"3654","mr carson"," But why would we ever want a telephone at Downton, my lord?",21,"01x07 - Episode Seven",191
"3655","robert, earl of grantham"," Well, they have their uses. You could speak to the housekeeper in London. That'd be helpful, surely.",21,"01x07 - Episode Seven",192
"3656","mr carson"," I hope I have not failed in my management of the recent move.",21,"01x07 - Episode Seven",193
"3657","robert, earl of grantham"," Not at all. But the telephone is here now, and the girls got used to it when we were in London. Besides, none of us know what the next few months will bring.",21,"01x07 - Episode Seven",194
"3658","mr carson"," Because of the Archduke's death?",21,"01x07 - Episode Seven",195
"3659","robert, earl of grantham"," Austria won't get what it wants from Serbia. And now Russia's starting to rumble. Well, there's not much we can do about that. So, will you take care of the telephone man?",21,"01x07 - Episode Seven",196
"3660","mr carson"," Oh, about Mr Bates, my lord. I expect you've had time to consider the contents of that letter?",21,"01x07 - Episode Seven",197
"3661","robert, earl of grantham"," Yes, but I find it very odd. Regimental silver? I could more easily see Bates as an assassin than a petty pilferer.",21,"01x07 - Episode Seven",198
"3662","mr carson"," I agree. And while the letter is hard to argue with, I wouldn't put anything past Thomas or Miss O'Brien.",21,"01x07 - Episode Seven",199

"3667","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," No!",22,"01x07 - Episode Seven",204
"3668","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," She's written to me. I should pay no attention.",22,"01x07 - Episode Seven",205
"3669","lady edith"," But Granny, she has got a point. Mary can't be completely naïve.",22,"01x07 - Episode Seven",206
"3670","lady mary"," I don't need your help, thank you.",22,"01x07 - Episode Seven",207
"3671","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," Mary, listen to me. If you take Matthew now when his whole future is at risk, he will love you to the end of his days.",22,"01x07 - Episode Seven",208
"3672","lady sybil"," Why, Granny, you're a romantic.",22,"01x07 - Episode Seven",209
"3673","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," I've been called many things, but never that.",22,"01x07 - Episode Seven",210

"3675","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," Mary can always change her mind.",22,"01x07 - Episode Seven",212
"3676","lady mary"," But I can't do that to Matthew. It's not how we are together.",22,"01x07 - Episode Seven",213

"3678","lady mary"," Now, I'm going upstairs to help Anna unpack.",22,"01x07 - Episode Seven",215

"3683","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," Any port in a storm. Oh, by the way, I was right about my maid. She's leaving to get married. I mean, how could she be so selfish?",22,"01x07 - Episode Seven",220
"3684","cora, countess of grantham"," I do sympathise. Robert's always wanting me to get rid of O'Brien, but I can't face it. Anyway, she's so fond of me.",22,"01x07 - Episode Seven",221
"3685","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," Well, I thought Simmons was fond of me. What am I to do?",22,"01x07 - Episode Seven",222
"3686","cora, countess of grantham"," Why don't I put an advertisement in The Lady? It's always the best place to start.",22,"01x07 - Episode Seven",223
"3687","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," Oh, that's so kind. Thank you. I really must be going. Now, don't let Mary wait for the baby before she gives Matthew her answer.",22,"01x07 - Episode Seven",224
"3688","cora, countess of grantham"," I'm sure it's another girl.",22,"01x07 - Episode Seven",225
"3689","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," I know those men of the moral high ground. If she won't say yes when he might be poor, he won't want her when he will be rich.",22,"01x07 - Episode Seven",226

"3714","mrs patmore"," Haven't you?",24,"01x07 - Episode Seven",251
"3715","robert, earl of grantham"," No. I understand you've had some trouble with your sight.",24,"01x07 - Episode Seven",252
"3716","mrs patmore"," That's just it! I know I could manage better if only--",24,"01x07 - Episode Seven",253
"3717","robert, earl of grantham"," Please, Mrs Patmore...",24,"01x07 - Episode Seven",254
"3718","anna bates"," Let him speak. Beg pardon, milord.",24,"01x07 - Episode Seven",255
"3719","robert, earl of grantham"," Don't apologise. Now, on Dr Clarkson's recommendation, I'm sending you up to London to see an eye specialist at Moorfields. Anna will go with you and you'll stay with my sister Rosamund in her new house in Belgrave Square.",24,"01x07 - Episode Seven",256
"3720","mrs patmore"," I'm afraid I'm going to have to sit in your presence, milord.",24,"01x07 - Episode Seven",257
"3721","robert, earl of grantham"," Of course.",24,"01x07 - Episode Seven",258
"3722","mrs patmore"," B--but how will you get on here?",24,"01x07 - Episode Seven",259
"3723","robert, earl of grantham"," Well, Mrs Crawley is lending us her cook, Mrs Bird. She's coming over tomorrow. You'll be good enough to show her how things work.",24,"01x07 - Episode Seven",260
"3724","mrs patmore"," A--are the Crawleys to starve while I'm away?",24,"01x07 - Episode Seven",261
"3725","robert, earl of grantham"," They'll eat here every evening. Now, my sister's butler will look after you. He's very nice. Anna, you won't mind a visit to London?",24,"01x07 - Episode Seven",262
"3726","anna bates"," No, milord. Thank you. It'll be an adventure.",24,"01x07 - Episode Seven",263
"3727","robert, earl of grantham"," One with a happy ending, I hope.",24,"01x07 - Episode Seven",264
"3728","matthew"," Let me get this clear. At Sybil's ball you said you'd give me your answer the day you got back, and now you say you will not.",25,"01x07 - Episode Seven",265
"3729","lady mary"," Why do we have to rush into it? I need to be sure, that's all.",25,"01x07 - Episode Seven",266
"3730","matthew"," But you were sure. Shall I tell you what I think has altered you? My prospects. Because nothing else has changed.",25,"01x07 - Episode Seven",267
"3731","lady mary"," No.",25,"01x07 - Episode Seven",268
"3732","matthew"," Yes! If your mother's child is a boy, then he's the heir and I go back to living on my wits, and you'd rather not follow me there.",25,"01x07 - Episode Seven",269
"3733","lady mary"," Oh, Matthew, you always make everything so black and white.",25,"01x07 - Episode Seven",270
"3734","matthew"," I think this is black and white. Do you love me enough to spend your life with me? If you don't, then say no. If you do, then say yes.",25,"01x07 - Episode Seven",271
"3735","lady mary"," I want to... Granny told me I should say yes now, then withdraw if you lost everything.",25,"01x07 - Episode Seven",272
"3736","matthew"," To make that work, you'd have to be a good liar. Are you a good liar?",25,"01x07 - Episode Seven",273
"3737","lady mary"," Well, not good enough to try it, apparently.",25,"01x07 - Episode Seven",274
"3738","robert, earl of grantham"," How could you not have realised they'd discover the loss at once? And to keep them in your house... But you only served two years?",26,"01x07 - Episode Seven",275
"3739","mr bates"," That's right, my lord.",26,"01x07 - Episode Seven",276
"3740","robert, earl of grantham"," So, clearly the judge thought there was some mitigating factor. I just want to know the truth.",26,"01x07 - Episode Seven",277
"3741","mr bates"," I cannot speak of it, milord. You must decide whether I stay or go on the basis of the evidence before you. I will respect that.",26,"01x07 - Episode Seven",278
"3742","anna bates"," Sorry, I don't believe it.",27,"01x07 - Episode Seven",279
"3743","mr bates"," How can you say that? When I've confessed to the crime?",27,"01x07 - Episode Seven",280
"3744","anna bates"," Well, His Lordship obviously doesn't think that's all there is to it, and I don't either.",27,"01x07 - Episode Seven",281
"3745","mrs patmore"," Daisy, have you finished the...",27,"01x07 - Episode Seven",282
"3746","mrs hughes"," Anna, are you set for the nine o'clock train tomorrow?",27,"01x07 - Episode Seven",283
"3747","anna bates"," All packed and ready.",27,"01x07 - Episode Seven",284
"3748","mrs hughes"," You'll be met at King's Cross by Lady Rosamund's chauffeur, which I think is generous, but after that you're on your own. Right. I must get on. I'm acting referee for Mrs Patmore and Mrs Bird.",27,"01x07 - Episode Seven",285
"3749","mr bates"," Best of luck.",27,"01x07 - Episode Seven",286
"3750","anna bates"," Will you miss me?",27,"01x07 - Episode Seven",287
"3751","mr bates"," Try not to miss me. It'll be good practice.",27,"01x07 - Episode Seven",288
"3752","mrs patmore"," I expect it'll be hard adjusting to this kitchen after the one you're used to.",28,"01x07 - Episode Seven",289
"3753","mrs bird"," Not to worry, I'm sure I can have it cleaned up in no time.",28,"01x07 - Episode Seven",290
"3754","mrs patmore"," Cleaned up?",28,"01x07 - Episode Seven",291
"3755","mrs bird"," I'm not criticising. With your eyesight, it's a wonder you could see the pots at all.",28,"01x07 - Episode Seven",292
"3756","mrs hughes"," You'll have met Daisy and the others?",28,"01x07 - Episode Seven",293
"3757","mrs bird"," I have. Though what they all find to do is a mystery to me.",28,"01x07 - Episode Seven",294
"3758","mrs patmore"," Are you not used to managing staff, Mrs Bird?",28,"01x07 - Episode Seven",295
"3759","mrs bird"," I'm used to getting it done with one kitchen maid, Mrs Patmore, but I suppose in a house like this, you expect to take it easy.",28,"01x07 - Episode Seven",296
"3760","anna bates"," Do you think we should erect a ring and let them fight it out?",28,"01x07 - Episode Seven",297
"3761","mr molesley"," She's all right, Mrs Bird. She's more of a general than a trooper, but you need that in a cook.",28,"01x07 - Episode Seven",298
"3762","anna bates","Well, Mrs Patmore's the Generalissimo.",28,"01x07 - Episode Seven",299
"3763","mrs patmore","...anything for Mrs Crawley and her son.",28,"01x07 - Episode Seven",300
"3764","isobel crawley"," Well, I'm very sad. I thought Mary was made of better stuff.",29,"01x07 - Episode Seven",301
"3765","matthew"," Don't speak against her.",29,"01x07 - Episode Seven",302
"3766","isobel crawley"," Of course, she's taken advice from someone with false and greedy values.",29,"01x07 - Episode Seven",303
"3767","matthew"," Oh, Mother.",29,"01x07 - Episode Seven",304
"3768","isobel crawley"," And we don't have to go too far to know who that is!",29,"01x07 - Episode Seven",305

"3770","isobel crawley"," I've a good mind to--",29,"01x07 - Episode Seven",307
"3771","matthew"," You are not to go near Cousin Violet. That is an order.",29,"01x07 - Episode Seven",308
"3772","robert, earl of grantham"," Something's not right about it.",30,"01x07 - Episode Seven",309
"3773","cora, countess of grantham"," I agree. Having a silver thief in the house does not seem right at all. Even if he could walk.",30,"01x07 - Episode Seven",310
"3774","robert, earl of grantham"," But Carson isn't keen to get rid of him, either, and he normally comes down on this sort of thing like a ton of bricks.",30,"01x07 - Episode Seven",311
"3775","cora, countess of grantham"," What's his reasoning?",30,"01x07 - Episode Seven",312
"3776","robert, earl of grantham"," He blames Thomas and O'Brien. He says they've been working against Bates since he got here.",30,"01x07 - Episode Seven",313
"3777","cora, countess of grantham"," So I should sack O'Brien instead?",30,"01x07 - Episode Seven",314
"3778","robert, earl of grantham"," You'll hear no argument from me.",30,"01x07 - Episode Seven",315
"3779","miss o'brien"," This should do the trick, milady.",30,"01x07 - Episode Seven",316
"3780","miss o'brien"," Ten years of my life that's what I've given her. Ten bloody years.",31,"01x07 - Episode Seven",317
"3781","thomas"," But did she say she'd sack you?",31,"01x07 - Episode Seven",318
"3782","miss o'brien"," It's obviously what he wants.",31,"01x07 - Episode Seven",319
"3783","thomas"," So when will they tell you?",31,"01x07 - Episode Seven",320
"3784","miss o'brien"," When they've found a replacement. Heaven forfend she should have to put a comb through her own hair. And if I'm going, you won't be far behind.",31,"01x07 - Episode Seven",321
"3785","thomas"," Oh, so what? Sod 'em. There's a war coming and war means change. We should be making plans.",31,"01x07 - Episode Seven",322
"3786","miss o'brien"," What you talking about?",31,"01x07 - Episode Seven",323
"3787","thomas"," Well, put it like this. I don't want to be a footman anymore, but I don't intend to be killed in battle, neither.",31,"01x07 - Episode Seven",324
"3788","mrs patmore"," I'm not saying poison them. Just make sure they don't find her food all that agreeable.",32,"01x07 - Episode Seven",325
"3789","daisy mason"," By poisoning it?",32,"01x07 - Episode Seven",326
"3790","mrs patmore"," Will you stop that!",32,"01x07 - Episode Seven",327
"3791","daisy mason"," You don't want it to taste nice.",32,"01x07 - Episode Seven",328
"3792","mrs patmore"," I want them to be glad when I get back. That's all.",32,"01x07 - Episode Seven",329
"3793","mr carson"," This will be for the family and the one in my pantry is for the staff. Or, more precisely, me.",33,"01x07 - Episode Seven",330
"3794","mr bromidge"," We don't normally provide two.",33,"01x07 - Episode Seven",331
"3795","mr carson"," Then perhaps we should find another supplier.",33,"01x07 - Episode Seven",332
"3796","mr bromidge"," Hold your horses. Right. Where do you see this other telephone?",33,"01x07 - Episode Seven",333
"3797","mr carson"," Here, in the outer hall.",33,"01x07 - Episode Seven",334

"3806","lady sybil"," I'm so sorry, Mr...?",33,"01x07 - Episode Seven",343
"3807","mr carson"," This is Mr Bromidge, my lady. He's here about the telephone.",33,"01x07 - Episode Seven",344

"3809","lady sybil"," We're so looking forward to it. What an exciting business to be in.",33,"01x07 - Episode Seven",346
"3810","sir anthony strallan"," You must be expanding every day.",33,"01x07 - Episode Seven",347
"3811","mr bromidge"," Ah, we are, sir. But, er, that brings its problems. Training up men for the work when many have no aptitude. Ha, I can't even find a secretary who can keep pace at the moment.",33,"01x07 - Episode Seven",348
"3812","lady sybil"," What?",33,"01x07 - Episode Seven",349
"3813","mr bromidge"," It's hard with a new concept. Too old, they can't change. Too young, and they've no experience.",33,"01x07 - Episode Seven",350
"3814","lady sybil"," But have you filled the post yet? Because I know just the woman.",33,"01x07 - Episode Seven",351

"3818","mrs patmore"," I don't know. No one told me there'd be an actual operation.",36,"01x07 - Episode Seven",355

"3821","anna bates"," She'll be fine, thank you.",36,"01x07 - Episode Seven",358
"3822","doctor"," And you've been, er, sent to us by the Earl of Grantham?",36,"01x07 - Episode Seven",359
"3823","anna bates"," That's right.",36,"01x07 - Episode Seven",360
"3824","doctor"," Very good. You can leave her now. We'll, er, keep her in for a week. You can collect her next Friday.",36,"01x07 - Episode Seven",361

"3838","anna bates"," That's correct.",40,"01x07 - Episode Seven",375
"3839","nco"," Well, I know who he is right enough. That was an odd business.",40,"01x07 - Episode Seven",376

"3841","nco"," Never mind.",40,"01x07 - Episode Seven",378
"3842","nco"," So you're his cousin and you'd like to be in touch?",40,"01x07 - Episode Seven",379
"3843","nco"," Very forgiving. Well, I've got no address for him or his wife. But I have got one for his mother, which should still be good. I've written it down for you.",40,"01x07 - Episode Seven",380
"3844","anna bates"," Thank you for your trouble.",40,"01x07 - Episode Seven",381

"3846","lady edith"," Who told you?",41,"01x07 - Episode Seven",383
"3847","lady mary"," Someone who knows that you did.",41,"01x07 - Episode Seven",384
"3848","lady edith"," Then why are you asking?",41,"01x07 - Episode Seven",385
"3849","lady mary"," Because I wanted to give you one last chance to deny it.",41,"01x07 - Episode Seven",386
"3850","lady edith"," And what if I did? He had a right to know how his countryman died. In the arms of a slut.",41,"01x07 - Episode Seven",387
"3851","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," How's that advertisement getting on for the new maid?",41,"01x07 - Episode Seven",388
"3852","cora, countess of grantham"," Well, it's only just come out.",41,"01x07 - Episode Seven",389

"3860","lady edith"," Well, he said he had a question for me. He told me he'd ask it at the garden party, and he hopes I'll say yes.",41,"01x07 - Episode Seven",397

"3862","robert, earl of grantham"," Carson's very wary...",41,"01x07 - Episode Seven",399
"3863","cora, countess of grantham"," You must think very carefully what your answer will be.",41,"01x07 - Episode Seven",400

"3866","robert, earl of grantham"," Yes, they do, in London anyway.",41,"01x07 - Episode Seven",403

"3870","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," First electricity, now telephones. Sometimes I feel as if I were living in a--an H.G. Wells novel. But the young are all so calm about change, aren't they? Look at Matthew. I do admire him.",41,"01x07 - Episode Seven",407
"3871","isobel crawley"," Do you?",41,"01x07 - Episode Seven",408
"3872","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," What have I done wrong now?",41,"01x07 - Episode Seven",409

"3874","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," Well, I shall pretend it. I told her to take him. Your quarrel is with my daughter Rosamund, not me.",41,"01x07 - Episode Seven",411
"3875","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," So, put that in your pipe and smoke it.",41,"01x07 - Episode Seven",412

"3880","thomas"," Mr Carson dropped his wallet in the passage. I was replacing it.",42,"01x07 - Episode Seven",417

"3888","mrs bird"," I don't mind if I do.",44,"01x07 - Episode Seven",425
"3889","daisy mason"," I'm not sure Mrs Patmore would like that, Mr Carson. Cook always eats separate, that's what she says.",44,"01x07 - Episode Seven",426
"3890","mr molesley"," Not in our house. There's only the four of us.",44,"01x07 - Episode Seven",427

"3898","mrs bird"," Tell us what's in it!",44,"01x07 - Episode Seven",435

"3902","mrs hughes"," Why, Daisy? Why would you do such a thing?!",44,"01x07 - Episode Seven",439
"3903","daisy mason"," Because Mrs Patmore was worried that they'd prefer Mrs Bird's cooking and they wouldn't want her to come back.",44,"01x07 - Episode Seven",440
"3904","mr carson"," Is that likely? When they've taken such trouble to get her well?",44,"01x07 - Episode Seven",441

"4199","robert, earl of grantham"," I don't see why not. Churchill went back to the front after the Gallipoli business. If he can do it, why shouldn't I? Sybil, are you all right?",6,"02x01 - Episode One",29

"4247","mr carson"," I do not agree. Keeping up standards is the only way to show the Germans that they will not beat us in the end.",11,"02x01 - Episode One",77
"4248","mrs hughes"," Well, give me some warning the next time we're expecting Germans at Downton, I'll see what I can do.",11,"02x01 - Episode One",78

"4254","robert, earl of grantham"," No, he wouldn't. But I'm glad he's all right. I miss him.",12,"02x01 - Episode One",84
"4255","isobel crawley"," Well, that's the point. You must know he's been down here a few times since the war started.",12,"02x01 - Episode One",85
"4256","cora, countess of grantham"," We had heard.",12,"02x01 - Episode One",86
"4257","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," Downton is hardly a metropolis.",12,"02x01 - Episode One",87
"4258","robert, earl of grantham"," Is he still determined to go back to Manchester when it's all over?",12,"02x01 - Episode One",88
"4259","isobel crawley"," He doesn't talk much about life after the war, none of them do. I suppose they don't want to tempt fate. Until now, that is. He writes that he's engaged to be married to a Miss Lavinia Swire.",12,"02x01 - Episode One",89
"4260","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," Well, I-- I suppose we all knew it would happen one day.",12,"02x01 - Episode One",90
"4261","robert, earl of grantham"," Do you know her?",12,"02x01 - Episode One",91
"4262","isobel crawley"," Not yet. Apparently they met when he was in England last time. It all seems rather hurried.",12,"02x01 - Episode One",92

"4265","cora, countess of grantham"," So, will you miss the concert?",12,"02x01 - Episode One",95
"4266","isobel crawley"," Well, that's up to you. We'd all hoped that he and Mary would sort things out between them, but if that's not to be, then shouldn't we try to get back to normal? Even if he's not keen to live in the village. He's still the heir. And you're still his family.",12,"02x01 - Episode One",96
"4267","robert, earl of grantham"," I quite agree. We can't know if Matthew will come through it. Either way, I would like to see him, and I want to wish him luck.",12,"02x01 - Episode One",97
"4268","cora, countess of grantham"," The trouble is Mary's back from London today as well. She gets in at five o'clock.",12,"02x01 - Episode One",98

"4271","cora, countess of grantham"," But should we tell her not to come? We might still catch her.",12,"02x01 - Episode One",101
"4272","robert, earl of grantham"," Isobel's right. We must use this engagement as a new beginning. You bring our Lieutenant Crawley to the concert and stay for dinner afterwards.",12,"02x01 - Episode One",102
"4273","isobel crawley"," I was hoping you'd say that.",12,"02x01 - Episode One",103

"4583","mr carson"," She asked Mrs Patmore for some cooking lessons.",40,"02x01 - Episode One",413

"4598","mr bates"," Look, I'm not saying it's all your fault for how things were between us, but I couldn't go back to that. I'll take the blame. I'll go to some hotel in Moulton with a tart. So why hold on?",42,"02x01 - Episode One",428
"4599","vera bates"," Because I tried it on my own and I don't like it. You've got money now. We'd be comfortable.",42,"02x01 - Episode One",429
"4600","mr bates"," You're out of your mind. What makes you think that I would allow that to happen?",42,"02x01 - Episode One",430
"4601","vera bates"," You went to prison for me once.",42,"02x01 - Episode One",431

"4603","mr bates"," Is that all?",42,"02x01 - Episode One",433
"4604","vera bates"," Not quite. You see, if you don't come back to me, I'm going to the newspapers with a cracking story, and I'd like to bet the Granthams won't survive it.",42,"02x01 - Episode One",434
"4605","mr bates"," Oh? And what nonsense is this?",42,"02x01 - Episode One",435
"4606","vera bates"," The nonsense I heard when I used your name to get a job with Lady Flintshire. His Lordship's cousin.",42,"02x01 - Episode One",436

"4610","vera bates"," As if. I said, why don't you tell me what you think you know, and I'll tell you if it's true. Goodness me, was my patience rewarded. The public's bored with the war, you see. They like gossip. And a diplomat dying in the bed of an earl's unmarried daughter, well! That takes the ticket for the tale of the year.",42,"02x01 - Episode One",440
"4611","mr bates"," It's a pack of lies!",42,"02x01 - Episode One",441
"4612","vera bates"," I assume that's loyalty and not ignorance. Because, you see, I heard that Lady Mary needed her maid to help her carry him. And, yes, you've guessed it, your precious Anna's gonna figure in the story, too. Not to worry too much. It's not a criminal offense, is it? Just a social one.",42,"02x01 - Episode One",442
"4613","mr bates"," You bitch.",42,"02x01 - Episode One",443
"4614","vera bates"," Please. Be my guest. But then you must excuse me while I run into town and have it photographed.",42,"02x01 - Episode One",444

"4616","vera bates"," Firstly, you'll hand in your notice. Tonight. I'll put up at the pub in the village.",42,"02x01 - Episode One",446
"4617","mr bates"," What reason do I give?",42,"02x01 - Episode One",447
"4618","vera bates"," You don't need a reason. Just tell them that you're going. And then tomorrow we head back to London. Stay in your mother's house for the time being till we get ourselves sorted. And in case you're wondering, whatever my future plans may be, they will involve you.",42,"02x01 - Episode One",448
"4619","robert, earl of grantham"," Bates, when you first came here, I fought to keep you! Everyone was against me! Everyone! From Her Ladyship to Carson! They thought I was mad!

"4633","anna bates"," Yes, you see, but that's just what I don't agree with. You had every right. I know you. You're doing something gallant here, making a sacrifice for my honour, but I don't want you to. I don't care! Don't you understand? I don't care what people say. I'd live in sin with you. If she's threatening to ruin me, then let her. It's nothing to me. The only ruin that I recognize is to be without you.",44,"02x01 - Episode One",463

"5284","anna bates"," Well, they do say honesty's the best policy, and I think you regret being honest less often than you regret telling lies.",40,"02x02 - Episode Two",444
"5285","dr clarkson"," He must've smuggled a razor into his bed. There was nothing to be done.",43,"02x02 - Episode Two",445

"5311","lady sybil"," No. No, it's more savage and more cruel than I could've imagined, but I feel useful for the first time in my life, and that must be a good thing. Matthew, are you busy?",45,"02x02 - Episode Two",471

"5712","isobel crawley"," The Middlesbrough General will have their own arrangements for where their patients convalesce.",21,"02x03 - Episode Three",256

"5738","lady sybil"," You never said.",24,"02x03 - Episode Three",282
"5739","tom"," Well, I'm saying it now. He was walking down North King's Street one day and an English soldier saw him and shot him dead. When they asked why he was killed, the officer said, ""Because he was probably a rebel."" So don't say you were not at your best.",24,"02x03 - Episode Three",283

"5768","lady mary"," I don't really see on what basis.",29,"02x03 - Episode Three",312
"5769","lady rosamund"," She stole secrets from her uncle, Jonathan Swire, and gave them to Carlisle to publish, Swire told me.",29,"02x03 - Episode Three",313
"5770","lady mary"," And the paper showed that half the cabinet were trying to get rich by buying shares before a government contract was announced. Would you rather we were kept in ignorance?",29,"02x03 - Episode Three",314

"5780","mr bates"," It was me. I knew you used to go to the village on Wednesday. I so longed for a glimpse of you.",31,"02x03 - Episode Three",324
"5781","anna bates"," But why're you up here at all? And why didn't you tell me?",31,"02x03 - Episode Three",325

"5783","anna bates"," You can't criticise her for that.",31,"02x03 - Episode Three",327

"5785","anna bates"," But what if she fights it?",31,"02x03 - Episode Three",329
"5786","mr bates"," She can't. For her to divorce me, she needs something beyond adultery, cruelty or such like. For a husband, adultery is enough.",31,"02x03 - Episode Three",330
"5787","anna bates"," That's not very fair to women.",31,"02x03 - Episode Three",331
"5788","mr bates"," I don't care about fairness, I care about you. The point is, I can get rid of her. If she goes quietly, I will give her money and plenty of it. If not, she leaves empty handed.",31,"02x03 - Episode Three",332
"5789","anna bates"," And when will this be?",31,"02x03 - Episode Three",333
"5790","mr bates"," I need to get her to accept it first. She's made threats about selling stuff to the papers.",31,"02x03 - Episode Three",334
"5791","anna bates"," What stuff?",31,"02x03 - Episode Three",335
"5792","mr bates"," Don't worry. They won't offer what I will. You've changed your hair.",31,"02x03 - Episode Three",336
"5793","anna bates"," I was trying out Lady Mary's new curling iron. What do you think?",31,"02x03 - Episode Three",337
"5794","mr bates"," I think I would love you however, and whatever, whenever.",31,"02x03 - Episode Three",338
"5795","anna bates"," We don't have to wait, you know. If you want me to throw up everything and come with you, I will. Gladly.",31,"02x03 - Episode Three",339
"5796","mr bates"," I can't marry you yet. Not legally. And I won't break the law.",31,"02x03 - Episode Three",340

"6238","mr molesley"," That brushing, for instance.",16,"02x04 - Episode Four",182
"6239","mr molesley"," I don't like having nothing to do. What with Captain Crawley away at the war and with his mother in France alongside him, and then His Lordship's without a valet a--and your plate is piled so high.",16,"02x04 - Episode Four",183
"6240","mr carson"," I am quite occupied, it's true.",16,"02x04 - Episode Four",184

"6278","anna bates"," The Red Lion in Kirkbymoorside.",22,"02x04 - Episode Four",222
"6279","robert, earl of grantham"," Oh. You've seen him, then?",22,"02x04 - Episode Four",223
"6280","anna bates"," I have. Yes, milord.",22,"02x04 - Episode Four",224
"6281","robert, earl of grantham"," And he's well?",22,"02x04 - Episode Four",225

"6285","robert, earl of grantham"," Very good. And what is his second reason for avoiding us?",22,"02x04 - Episode Four",229
"6286","anna bates"," He says he parted with Your Lordship on bad terms. He felt it might be embarrassing.",22,"02x04 - Episode Four",230

"6288","mrs patmore"," I had to get out of that kitchen if I'm not to be found dead under the table. It's like cooking a banquet three times a day.",23,"02x04 - Episode Four",232

"6297","mrs bird"," One at a time. Take a piece of bread",24,"02x04 - Episode Four",241
"6298","mrs patmore"," Right. Daisy, stand there. Give them a bowl and a spoon. When did all this start?",24,"02x04 - Episode Four",242

"6300","daisy mason"," What does Mrs Crawley say?",24,"02x04 - Episode Four",244

"6303","mrs bird"," To be honest, Mrs Patmore, I'm not sure I can manage much longer.",24,"02x04 - Episode Four",247
"6304","mrs patmore"," Well, how often do you do it?",24,"02x04 - Episode Four",248
"6305","mrs bird"," Plan to get it down to once a week and give 'em only the cheapest cuts, but it is my money. And I don't know how much--",24,"02x04 - Episode Four",249
"6306","mrs patmore"," No, hold it right there. If we can't feed a few soldiers in our own village, them as have taken the bullet or worse for king and country, then I don't know what.",24,"02x04 - Episode Four",250
"6307","daisy mason"," Sorry about this, milady. Only there's no footmen to do it now.",25,"02x04 - Episode Four",251

"6311","lady edith"," I know William.",25,"02x04 - Episode Four",255
"6312","daisy mason"," Well, he's missing. That is, he was supposed to be back on leave, but he never turned up. He wrote he was coming home for a few days with Captain Crawley.",25,"02x04 - Episode Four",256
"6313","lady edith"," Is William your beau?",25,"02x04 - Episode Four",257

"6317","robert, earl of grantham"," But how do you know they didn't change their plans?",26,"02x04 - Episode Four",261
"6318","lady edith"," Well, of course I don't, but the poor girl seemed quite certain.",26,"02x04 - Episode Four",262
"6319","robert, earl of grantham"," Just when Isobel is away and none of us know where she is. Typical.",26,"02x04 - Episode Four",263

"6325","mrs patmore"," Borrow? Why? Are you planning to give it back?",27,"02x04 - Episode Four",269
"6326","robert, earl of grantham"," I'm afraid I do. Can you get Pratt to take you in the other car?",29,"02x04 - Episode Four",270
"6327","cora, countess of grantham"," Doesn't matter, I can go on Monday. But why?",29,"02x04 - Episode Four",271
"6328","robert, earl of grantham"," I'm told Bates is working at a public house in Kirkbymoorside. I want to investigate.",29,"02x04 - Episode Four",272
"6329","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," I can't decide which part of that speech is the most extraordinary. Why can't someone else go?",29,"02x04 - Episode Four",273
"6330","robert, earl of grantham"," Because I want to go myself.",29,"02x04 - Episode Four",274
"6331","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," So, Sybil, what are you up to, dear?",29,"02x04 - Episode Four",275
"6332","lady sybil"," Nothing much. Working. I don't have time to get up to anything else.",29,"02x04 - Episode Four",276
"6333","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," Only, Mary and I were talking about you. You know, the other day.",29,"02x04 - Episode Four",277
"6334","lady sybil"," Oh?",29,"02x04 - Episode Four",278
"6335","lady mary"," I didn't say anything.",29,"02x04 - Episode Four",279
"6336","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," Yes, you see, sometimes in war, one can make friendships that aren't quite…appropriate. And can be awkward, you know, later on. I mean, we've all done it. I just want you to be on your guard.",29,"02x04 - Episode Four",280
"6337","lady sybil"," Appropriate for whom?",29,"02x04 - Episode Four",281
"6338","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," Well, don't jump down my throat, dear. I'm only offering friendly advice.",29,"02x04 - Episode Four",282
"6339","cora, countess of grantham"," Why do you want to see Bates? To give him his old job back?",29,"02x04 - Episode Four",283
"6340","robert, earl of grantham"," Not entirely. I mainly want to see him because we parted badly.",29,"02x04 - Episode Four",284
"6341","robert, earl of grantham"," Telephone call for you, milord.",29,"02x04 - Episode Four",285
"6342","cora, countess of grantham"," If you did, I'm sure it's his fault.",29,"02x04 - Episode Four",286
"6343","robert, earl of grantham"," No, it was mine.",29,"02x04 - Episode Four",287
"6344","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," Oh, really. It's like living in a second rate hotel where the guests keep arriving and no one seems to leave. (sigh)",29,"02x04 - Episode Four",288
"6345","robert, earl of grantham"," I see.",30,"02x04 - Episode Four",289
"6346","cora, countess of grantham"," I had an idea of going up to London for some…",30,"02x04 - Episode Four",290
"6347","robert, earl of grantham"," Yes. Thank you for letting me know.",30,"02x04 - Episode Four",291
"6348","lady edith"," Are you all right, Papa?",30,"02x04 - Episode Four",292
"6349","robert, earl of grantham"," That was the war office. Matthew and William went out on a patrol a few days ago and they haven't been seen since.",30,"02x04 - Episode Four",293
"6350","lady edith"," Oh, my God.",30,"02x04 - Episode Four",294
"6351","robert, earl of grantham"," Let's not fall to pieces quite yet. It happens all the time, apparently, and the men turn up in one field hospital or another.",30,"02x04 - Episode Four",295
"6352","lady edith"," But they are treating them as Missing In Action?",30,"02x04 - Episode Four",296
"6353","robert, earl of grantham"," It's too early for that. There could be lots of things to explain it.",30,"02x04 - Episode Four",297
"6354","lady edith"," You mean they could've been taken prisoner.",30,"02x04 - Episode Four",298
"6355","robert, earl of grantham"," It's possible. Don't say anything to Mary. Or your mother. Or anyone, in fact. Not yet. I shouldn't really have told you.",30,"02x04 - Episode Four",299
"6356","lady edith"," What about Cousin Isobel?",30,"02x04 - Episode Four",300
"6357","robert, earl of grantham"," I don't know how to contact her. Anyway, she's in France. She may hear before we do.",30,"02x04 - Episode Four",301
"6358","miss o'brien"," I'm not accusing her of anything. I did wonder if you were aware of this special storage area.",31,"02x04 - Episode Four",302
"6359","mrs hughes"," I daresay Mrs Patmore has her own system like we all do.",31,"02x04 - Episode Four",303
"6360","miss o'brien"," Right. Well, I'll say goodnight.",31,"02x04 - Episode Four",304

"6362","mrs hughes"," Ah, Mr Molesley. You're very late.",31,"02x04 - Episode Four",306
"6363","mr molesley"," I was doing some invisible mending on one of his coats. I got a bit carried away. But I'm-- I'm quite pleased with the way it turned out.",31,"02x04 - Episode Four",307
"6364","mrs hughes"," I don't see why you can't dress him. Until there's a new valet, it'd be a blessing to Mr Carson.",31,"02x04 - Episode Four",308
"6365","mr molesley"," I'd be happy to if it'd help.",31,"02x04 - Episode Four",309
"6366","mrs hughes"," Keep this up and we won't be able to do without you at all.",31,"02x04 - Episode Four",310
"6367","mr molesley"," There's no reason why you should. Oh, er, I may be wrong, but I thought I saw one of the officers by the main staircase just now. I'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable explanation.",31,"02x04 - Episode Four",311
"6368","mrs hughes"," Let's hope so. Goodnight.",31,"02x04 - Episode Four",312
"6369","major bryant"," What the bloody...?",31,"02x04 - Episode Four",313
"6370","mrs hughes"," Ethel!",31,"02x04 - Episode Four",314
"6371","major bryant"," We were only--",31,"02x04 - Episode Four",315
"6372","mrs hughes"," I know precisely what you were doing, Major. I may not be a woman of the world, but I don't live in a sack! Now, if you will kindly take your things and go downstairs.",31,"02x04 - Episode Four",316
"6373","mrs hughes"," Ethel, you are dismissed without notice and without a character. You will please leave before breakfast.",31,"02x04 - Episode Four",317
"6374","ethel"," I didn't think how--",31,"02x04 - Episode Four",318
"6375","mrs hughes"," No. And that's a problem. You never do.",31,"02x04 - Episode Four",319
"6376","mrs bird"," And you're not nervous?",32,"02x04 - Episode Four",320
"6377","mr molesley"," Well, I gather His Lordship knows his own mind, but I've no difficulty with that.",32,"02x04 - Episode Four",321
"6378","mrs bird"," You'll enjoy working in a big household. Better than staring at me night after night. What would you say if they ask you to stay?",32,"02x04 - Episode Four",322

"6393","anna bates"," But surely--",35,"02x04 - Episode Four",337
"6394","mrs hughes"," Nevermind why she's gone. She's gone. And there's an end to it. By the way, I hear Mr Bates is back in the county. Mr Carson says you know all about it. I gather His Lordship has gone to see him.",35,"02x04 - Episode Four",338
"6395","anna bates"," I know. He told me he was going.",35,"02x04 - Episode Four",339

"6399","mr bates"," She won't carry them out. Not now. Since I've left Downton, I've discovered that she was untrue to me.

"6403","mr bates"," Some silly nonsense, milord. I wouldn't waste your time with it. What's the news from Downton?",36,"02x04 - Episode Four",347
"6404","mrs hughes"," Daisy, you're not to worry about William. I spoke to His Lordship earlier. He says you're not to be concerned until we know more.",37,"02x04 - Episode Four",348
"6405","daisy mason"," But he is missing. I mean, they don't know where he is, or Captain Crawley, do they?",37,"02x04 - Episode Four",349
"6406","mrs hughes"," There could be a hundred explanations.",37,"02x04 - Episode Four",350

"6413","mrs hughes"," Why is that, Thomas? Because a place is already taken?",37,"02x04 - Episode Four",357
"6414","robert, earl of grantham"," I hate the word ""missing."" It seems to leave so little room for optimism. I tell myself it's too early to despair...but to be honest, Bates, I don't think I can bear it. Losing Patrick was bad enough, but now the thought o Matthew gone...and the future once again destroyed. More than all that, I loved him like a son. No, I love him. Let's stay in the present tense while we still can. So, will you come back with me and help me through the veil of shadow?",38,"02x04 - Episode Four",358

"6420","lady mary"," She thinks you must have a beau, and if we don't know about him, then you have to be keeping him secret. It's just Granny being Granny. Don't make such a thing of it.",40,"02x04 - Episode Four",364
"6421","lady sybil"," I don't deserve to be told off. Not by her or by you. Nothing's happened.",40,"02x04 - Episode Four",365

"6497","tom"," What work? Bringing hot drinks to a lot of randy officers? Look, it comes down to whether or not you love me. That's all. That's it. The rest is detail.",43,"02x04 - Episode Four",441
"6498","mr bates"," I've written to Vera spelling out the case and how she cannot win it. Then I have told her I will be generous if she will cooperate.",44,"02x04 - Episode Four",442

"6779","lady mary"," He's alive, isn't he?",1,"02x05 - Episode Five",158

"7153","cora, countess of grantham"," Well, Turkey's about to capitulate, and Robert says Vittorio Veneto will finish Austria. So, it's only a matter of weeks, even days, before it's over. We wouldn't send anyone home too soon, of course, but sometime in the new year, we will have our house back.",4,"02x06 - Episode Six",38
"7154","isobel crawley"," So you want it just to be a private house again?",4,"02x06 - Episode Six",39
"7155","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," Well, shouldn't she? Or would you like to abolish private houses?",4,"02x06 - Episode Six",40

"7158","isobel crawley"," Oh, please. Let me look into keeping it open as a centre of recovery.",4,"02x06 - Episode Six",43
"7159","isobel crawley"," I could run it. The house could be so much more than it was before.",4,"02x06 - Episode Six",44

"7170","lady edith"," Er, yes. But I'm afraid I'm not much good at family history. Although, Papa's found an aunt in 1860 who married a Gordon. Perhaps that's a clue.",5,"02x06 - Episode Six",55

"7191","sir richard carlisle"," Thank you. Although, it would mean a considerable increase in salary. Lady Mary and I intend to buy a home near Downton.

"7196","mr carson"," One thing I must ask. Is Lady Mary aware that you have approached me?",7,"02x06 - Episode Six",81

"7238","cora, countess of grantham"," Carson is right, Mrs Hughes.",13,"02x06 - Episode Six",123
"7239","mrs hughes"," But the girl was our employee, and while she was in the wrong--",13,"02x06 - Episode Six",124
"7240","mr carson"," Indeed, she was. Men will always be men, but for any young woman to let her judgment so desert her,",13,"02x06 - Episode Six",125
"7241","cora, countess of grantham"," She's not the first girl to be taken in by a uniform. And don't worry, Carson, the baby will ensure she pays the price. Has she tried to get the father to assume some responsibility?",13,"02x06 - Episode Six",126

"7261","mr carson"," Jane, have you finished in here?",15,"02x06 - Episode Six",146
"7262","mr carson"," I hope she wasn't talking out of turn, my lord.",15,"02x06 - Episode Six",147
"7263","robert, earl of grantham"," Not at all. It was my fault, I asked her questions.",15,"02x06 - Episode Six",148

"7265","mrs hughes"," Why? What difference will it make? We're not in the fourteenth century.",16,"02x06 - Episode Six",150

"7267","mrs hughes"," What's he done? That all young men aren't anxious to do behind the bicycle sheds every night?",16,"02x06 - Episode Six",152
"7268","ethel"," Then what am I going to do? If Major Bryant doesn't come 'round?",16,"02x06 - Episode Six",153
"7269","mrs hughes"," Who knows. Go to a big city. Invent a past. You've broken the rules, my girl, and it's no good pretending they're easily mended.",16,"02x06 - Episode Six",154

"7280","lady edith"," I know. Why am I being so silly?",18,"02x06 - Episode Six",165
"7281","patrick gordon"," It's funny, isn't it? I came here all the time when I was growing up.",18,"02x06 - Episode Six",166

"7284","lady edith"," But Patrick's--",18,"02x06 - Episode Six",169
"7285","patrick gordon"," Dead? Drowned on the Titanic? Of course, this must be very hard for you.",18,"02x06 - Episode Six",170
"7286","mr bates"," That's ridiculous. (listens) No, I'm sorry. Of course I'm not saying it's your fault. It's mine. It's all mine. (listens) Yes. Thank you. Goodbye.",19,"02x06 - Episode Six",171
"7287","mr bates"," She's only gone and told the judge that I paid her to agree to a divorce.",19,"02x06 - Episode Six",172
"7288","anna bates"," I suppose you did, didn't you?",19,"02x06 - Episode Six",173
"7289","mr bates"," Yes, I bloody well did.",19,"02x06 - Episode Six",174
"7290","anna bates"," So, what does it mean?",19,"02x06 - Episode Six",175
"7291","mr bates"," Because we withheld it from the court, it means the judge can withdraw the decree nisi. It means I'm not divorced after all. And, above all, it means...that I am a stupid...stupid, stupid man.",19,"02x06 - Episode Six",176
"7292","anna bates"," This won't change a thing. We are going to be together whether she wants it or not. If we have to leave here, if we have to leave the country, we are going to be together.",19,"02x06 - Episode Six",177
"7293","patrick gordon"," I was on the Titanic. That much is true. But I was pulled out of the water by Fifth Officer Lowe, the only one of them to come back. At least, that's what they said later. When I properly came 'round, they misidentified me as Canadian, shipped me up to Montreal.",20,"02x06 - Episode Six",178
"7294","lady edith"," I don't understand. Why didn't you just tell them who you were?",20,"02x06 - Episode Six",179
"7295","patrick gordon"," Because I couldn't remember. I don't know if it was the blow to the head or the-- the shock, or cold, but I had no memory. As far as I knew, I was Canadian.",20,"02x06 - Episode Six",180
"7296","lady edith"," So, what happened?",20,"02x06 - Episode Six",181
"7297","patrick gordon"," Well, I--I had no reason to go back to England, so in the end, I took my name from a gin bottle, and then, in 1914 I joined Princess Pat's Infantry.",20,"02x06 - Episode Six",182
"7298","lady edith"," Then what changed?",20,"02x06 - Episode Six",183
"7299","patrick gordon"," I was caught in a big explosion at Passchendaele. When I woke up, it all came back. Suddenly I knew who I was. I began to call myself Patrick again.",20,"02x06 - Episode Six",184
"7300","lady edith"," Why not your whole name? And why didn't you send a message at once?",20,"02x06 - Episode Six",185
"7301","patrick gordon"," I nearly did. And then I heard that Downton was an officer's convalescent home. I thought that if I came here and you knew me, the hard part would be over.",20,"02x06 - Episode Six",186
"7302","lady edith"," But we didn't know you.",20,"02x06 - Episode Six",187
"7303","patrick gordon"," Precisely.",20,"02x06 - Episode Six",188
"7304","lady edith"," I must talk to Papa. We've Matthew, the new heir, to think about.",20,"02x06 - Episode Six",189
"7305","patrick gordon"," Ah. The new heir. Yes, uh, this will be very difficult for him, of course.",20,"02x06 - Episode Six",190
"7306","lady edith"," And it must be so hard for you, what with Mary getting married.",20,"02x06 - Episode Six",191
"7307","patrick gordon"," Did I love her very much?",20,"02x06 - Episode Six",192
"7308","lady edith"," Well, I'm the wrong person to ask.",20,"02x06 - Episode Six",193
"7309","patrick gordon"," Because you were the one who really loved me, you mean?",20,"02x06 - Episode Six",194
"7310","lady edith"," I never thought Patrick knew.",20,"02x06 - Episode Six",195
"7311","patrick gordon"," Well, he did. I--I do.",20,"02x06 - Episode Six",196
"7312","lady mary"," It's big. The staircase is prettier than the one here. But mainly, it's just big.",21,"02x06 - Episode Six",197
"7313","matthew"," Can we stop? I'd much rather see your face when we talk.",21,"02x06 - Episode Six",198
"7314","matthew"," So, will you buy it?",21,"02x06 - Episode Six",199
"7315","lady mary"," Probably. He says he wants to steal Carson to come and run it for us.",21,"02x06 - Episode Six",200
"7316","matthew"," I don't envy you telling your Papa.",21,"02x06 - Episode Six",201
"7317","lady mary"," Hm. Suppose Carson won't do it.",21,"02x06 - Episode Six",202
"7318","matthew"," Since he would open his veins for you, I don't think there's much doubt.",21,"02x06 - Episode Six",203
"7319","lady mary"," I don't have to marry him, you know.",21,"02x06 - Episode Six",204
"7320","matthew"," Yes, you do. If I thought for a moment that I was an argument against your marriage, I should jump into the nearest river.",21,"02x06 - Episode Six",205
"7321","lady mary"," And how would you manage that without my help?",21,"02x06 - Episode Six",206
"7322","matthew"," Well, I'd get you to push me in.",21,"02x06 - Episode Six",207
"7323","matthew"," Seriously, I can only relax because I know that you have a real life coming. If I ever thought I was putting that in jeopardy, I'd go away and never see you again.",21,"02x06 - Episode Six",208
"7324","lady mary"," You don't mean that.",21,"02x06 - Episode Six",209
"7325","matthew"," But I do. I am the cat that walks by himself and all places are alike to me. I have nothing to give and nothing to share. If you were not engaged to be married, I wouldn't let you anywhere near me.",21,"02x06 - Episode Six",210
"7326","sir richard carlisle"," You'd think he was in Mary's sole charge. I'm worried it'll mean a big adjustment for him when we marry.",21,"02x06 - Episode Six",211
"7327","cora, countess of grantham"," I don't believe Matthew has any desire to stop her marrying, Richard. Quite the contrary.",21,"02x06 - Episode Six",212
"7328","sir richard carlisle"," Maybe. But is she as convinced as he is that they have no future?",21,"02x06 - Episode Six",213
"7329","cora, countess of grantham"," What are you saying?",21,"02x06 - Episode Six",214
"7330","sir richard carlisle"," I suppose I'm asking whether you want Mary to have children. Because if you do, isn't it time for Lavinia Swire to come back into his life?",21,"02x06 - Episode Six",215
"7331","lady sybil"," I wish I knew how an engine worked.",22,"02x06 - Episode Six",216
"7332","tom"," I can teach you if you'd like.",22,"02x06 - Episode Six",217
"7333","lady sybil"," That's Edith's territory.",22,"02x06 - Episode Six",218
"7334","tom"," I thought you were avoiding me.",22,"02x06 - Episode Six",219
"7335","lady sybil"," Of course not.",22,"02x06 - Episode Six",220
"7336","tom"," But you haven't come up with an answer yet, have you?",22,"02x06 - Episode Six",221
"7337","lady sybil"," Not yet, I'm afraid. I know you want to play your part in Ireland's troubles, and I respect that. But I just can't think about it all until the war is over. It won't be long now. So, will you wait?",22,"02x06 - Episode Six",222
"7338","tom"," I'd wait forever.",22,"02x06 - Episode Six",223
"7339","lady sybil"," I'm not asking for forever. Just a few more weeks.",22,"02x06 - Episode Six",224
"7340","thomas"," You know, Old Ma Patmore's not as mad as I thought.",23,"02x06 - Episode Six",225
"7341","miss o'brien"," Why do you say that?",23,"02x06 - Episode Six",226
"7342","thomas"," I made some inquiries and she's right. There's a big demand for rationed food if I can find it.",23,"02x06 - Episode Six",227
"7343","miss o'brien"," And can you?",23,"02x06 - Episode Six",228
"7344","thomas"," Maybe. Been given a name. I'll have to come up with the money, though.",23,"02x06 - Episode Six",229
"7345","miss o'brien"," And can you find the money?",23,"02x06 - Episode Six",230
"7346","thomas"," I think so. I've a bit put by, and I could borrow some.",23,"02x06 - Episode Six",231
"7347","miss o'brien"," It's a risk, though, isn't it?",23,"02x06 - Episode Six",232
"7348","thomas"," You got to speculate to accumulate. Hadn't you heard?",23,"02x06 - Episode Six",233
"7349","miss o'brien"," No. But I know the one about neither a borrower nor a lender be.",23,"02x06 - Episode Six",234
"7350","robert, earl of grantham"," What do you think? All the chaps are wearing them in London. Only for informal evenings, of course.",24,"02x06 - Episode Six",235
"7351","mr bates"," I'm not sure you'll get much use out of it when the war is over.",24,"02x06 - Episode Six",236
"7352","robert, earl of grantham"," Maybe not. But I can wear it when Her Ladyship and I are on our own. You're very preoccupied tonight.",24,"02x06 - Episode Six",237
"7353","lady edith"," Papa, can I have a word?",24,"02x06 - Episode Six",238
"7354","robert, earl of grantham"," Now?",24,"02x06 - Episode Six",239
"7355","robert, earl of grantham"," What is it?",24,"02x06 - Episode Six",240
"7356","lady edith"," I think you better sit down.",24,"02x06 - Episode Six",241
"7357","lady mary"," I knew you'd be in here...making last minute adjustments.",25,"02x06 - Episode Six",242
"7358","mr carson"," Never leave anything to chance, my lady, that's my motto.",25,"02x06 - Episode Six",243
"7359","lady mary"," Mine too, really. Sometimes I wish it wasn't. I gather Sir Richard's asked you about coming with us when we're married.",25,"02x06 - Episode Six",244
"7360","mr carson"," I need to hear what you think.",25,"02x06 - Episode Six",245
"7361","lady mary"," It's a terrific idea. If anyone can keep me out of trouble, it's you.",25,"02x06 - Episode Six",246
"7362","mr carson"," What about His Lordship?",25,"02x06 - Episode Six",247
"7363","lady mary"," Of course he'll kill me. But I'm sure he'll understand.",25,"02x06 - Episode Six",248
"7364","mr carson"," Well, I'll give you my answer when you've spoken to His Lordship. It'd be a huge wrench for me to leave Downton.",25,"02x06 - Episode Six",249
"7365","robert, earl of grantham"," Major Gordon, Edith has given me an account of your conversation.",26,"02x06 - Episode Six",250
"7366","patrick gordon"," She said she would.",26,"02x06 - Episode Six",251
"7367","robert, earl of grantham"," I wish you'd spoken to me first. Obviously, I need time to consider what you've said.",26,"02x06 - Episode Six",252
"7368","patrick gordon"," Well, I--I can offer little proof except that I know things only the real Patrick would know. I was never fingerprinted or anything.",26,"02x06 - Episode Six",253
"7369","robert, earl of grantham"," Presumably, you understand that people would be seriously affected should your story be true.",26,"02x06 - Episode Six",254
"7370","patrick gordon"," You mean Cousin Matthew.",26,"02x06 - Episode Six",255
"7371","robert, earl of grantham"," It would be very hard on Matthew.",26,"02x06 - Episode Six",256
"7372","patrick gordon"," Of course it would, but-- Robert, I--",26,"02x06 - Episode Six",257
"7373","patrick gordon"," I--I mean, Lord Grantham, if you'd prefer it.",26,"02x06 - Episode Six",258
"7374","robert, earl of grantham"," I would, until we know more.",26,"02x06 - Episode Six",259
"7375","patrick gordon"," When I was in the hospital, I had my story written down.",26,"02x06 - Episode Six",260
"7376","patrick gordon"," So you can have it checked, as far as that's possible.",26,"02x06 - Episode Six",261
"7377","robert, earl of grantham"," Thank you. I'll send it to my lawyers in London and I'll break the news to the family tomorrow.",26,"02x06 - Episode Six",262
"7378","robert, earl of grantham"," Where did you learn to do that?",26,"02x06 - Episode Six",263
"7379","patrick gordon"," Do what?",26,"02x06 - Episode Six",264
"7380","robert, earl of grantham"," Nevermind.",26,"02x06 - Episode Six",265
"7381","patrick gordon"," Am I really a stranger? Do you not recognise me at all? It feels very odd to be talking so formally.",26,"02x06 - Episode Six",266
"7382","robert, earl of grantham"," The whole situation is certainly odd. That I freely admit.",26,"02x06 - Episode Six",267
"7383","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," The war may be at an end, but the upheaval is only beginning.",27,"02x06 - Episode Six",268
"7384","isobel crawley"," Oh, how right you are. That is why Downton Abbey still has such an important role to play.",27,"02x06 - Episode Six",269
"7385","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," Well, dear me, there's so much to be done. When you think of all the children laid up with a disease.",27,"02x06 - Episode Six",270
"7386","isobel crawley"," But they're making such advances now aren't they? Now, could we talk about the lecture programme for Downton--?",27,"02x06 - Episode Six",271
"7387","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," We must, we must. If only I wasn't haunted by those women whose jobs will be snatched from them when the boys come home.",27,"02x06 - Episode Six",272
"7388","isobel crawley"," But we have to find work for our heroes, don't we? That must be our priority.",27,"02x06 - Episode Six",273
"7389","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," Mm.",27,"02x06 - Episode Six",274
"7390","isobel crawley"," However hard that might sound.",27,"02x06 - Episode Six",275
"7391","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," Mm. As you say. And what about those wretched refugees? What will become of them?",27,"02x06 - Episode Six",276
"7392","isobel crawley"," Ah. Now you've struck a chord.",27,"02x06 - Episode Six",277
"7393","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," Have I really? Oh, thank heaven.",27,"02x06 - Episode Six",278
"7394","isobel crawley"," What do you mean?",27,"02x06 - Episode Six",279
"7395","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," Mm? Nothing. Only the thought of those poor men and women flung across Europe far from their homelands, and so much in need of your help.",27,"02x06 - Episode Six",280
"7396","isobel crawley"," My help? Why do you say that?",27,"02x06 - Episode Six",281
"7397","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," When it comes to helping refugees, your experience renders your value beyond price. One of the organisers said those words.",27,"02x06 - Episode Six",282
"7398","isobel crawley"," Which organiser?",27,"02x06 - Episode Six",283
"7399","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," I forget.",27,"02x06 - Episode Six",284
"7400","isobel crawley"," What about running Downton? I can't do both.",27,"02x06 - Episode Six",285
"7401","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," Well, I suppose you must decide what is more important",27,"02x06 - Episode Six",286
"7402","isobel crawley"," I must go. But I will think about it.",27,"02x06 - Episode Six",287
"7403","isobel crawley"," Are you coming to Cousin Robert's dinner tonight?",27,"02x06 - Episode Six",288
"7404","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," Are you?",27,"02x06 - Episode Six",289
"7405","isobel crawley"," Well, I didn't feel I could say no. He sent a note this morning and was most insistent. What's it about?",27,"02x06 - Episode Six",290
"7406","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," I have no idea. But we'll talk there. We're onto something for you. We mustn't let the iron grow cold.",27,"02x06 - Episode Six",291
"7407","isobel crawley"," Thank you.",27,"02x06 - Episode Six",292
"7408","robert, earl of grantham"," You know there is nothing more ill-bred than to steal other people's servants.",28,"02x06 - Episode Six",293
"7409","lady mary"," But you're not ""other people"". And Carson brought me up.",28,"02x06 - Episode Six",294
"7410","robert, earl of grantham"," What does he say?",28,"02x06 - Episode Six",295
"7411","lady mary"," That he won't do anything without your permission.",28,"02x06 - Episode Six",296
"7412","robert, earl of grantham"," (chuckles/scoffs) Which, of course, is so cunning. How can I refuse a man who says that? What do you say, Bates?",28,"02x06 - Episode Six",297
"7413","mr bates"," I say Mr Carson must have the last word on where he lives and works.",28,"02x06 - Episode Six",298
"7414","robert, earl of grantham"," You're ganging up on me.",28,"02x06 - Episode Six",299
"7415","lady mary"," You're a darling and I love you. Now, what's this dinner all about?",28,"02x06 - Episode Six",300
"7416","lady mary"," Won't you tell me?",28,"02x06 - Episode Six",301
"7417","robert, earl of grantham"," You'll find out.",28,"02x06 - Episode Six",302
"7418","robert, earl of grantham"," I'm sorry if it's a bit of a crush. I didn't want to be overheard.",30,"02x06 - Episode Six",303
"7419","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," Are we talking financial ruin? Or criminal investigation?",30,"02x06 - Episode Six",304
"7420","robert, earl of grantham"," Neither. I'll get straight to the point. We have a patient who has been badly burned who goes by the name of Patrick Gordon, but he claims to be Patrick Crawley.",30,"02x06 - Episode Six",305
"7421","isobel crawley"," But I thought he was dead. Didn't he drown on the Titanic?",30,"02x06 - Episode Six",306
"7422","robert, earl of grantham"," Well, of course, it is what we all thought until now.",30,"02x06 - Episode Six",307
"7423","lady edith"," They never found a body.",30,"02x06 - Episode Six",308
"7424","lady mary"," They never found lots of bodies.",30,"02x06 - Episode Six",309
"7425","sir richard carlisle"," I'm so sorry, but I'm not quite on top of this. Who's Patrick Crawley?",30,"02x06 - Episode Six",310
"7426","matthew"," The man who would displace me as heir. If he's alive, then I'm no longer the future Earl of Grantham.",30,"02x06 - Episode Six",311
"7427","lady mary"," It's ridiculous. How can it be true? Where's he been hiding for the last six years?",30,"02x06 - Episode Six",312
"7428","lady edith"," In Canada, suffering from amnesia.",30,"02x06 - Episode Six",313
"7429","robert, earl of grantham"," He does have a story that would explain it. I'm not quite sure about how to test the facts.",30,"02x06 - Episode Six",314
"7430","lady edith"," He knows all sorts of things that only Patrick, or someone very close to him, would know.",30,"02x06 - Episode Six",315
"7431","lady mary"," What a stupid thing to say. Any fortune teller at a fair comes up with a dozen details he couldn't possibly know.",30,"02x06 - Episode Six",316
"7432","cora, countess of grantham"," There's no need to be angry. This young man is either Patrick or he's not. There must be a way to find out. Is he like Patrick to look at?",30,"02x06 - Episode Six",317
"7433","lady mary"," He isn't like anything to look at.",30,"02x06 - Episode Six",318
"7434","robert, earl of grantham"," I've sent his account up to George Murray in London to ask for his advice.",30,"02x06 - Episode Six",319
"7435","lady mary"," But what a waste of time and money.",30,"02x06 - Episode Six",320
"7436","lady edith"," What's the matter? We were all so fond of Patrick. You were going to marry him, for heaven's sake! Aren't you glad if he survived?",30,"02x06 - Episode Six",321
"7437","sir richard carlisle"," Dear me, should I be worried?",30,"02x06 - Episode Six",322
"7438","lady mary"," Certainly not. This man is a fake and an imposter, and I think it's a cruel trick to play when Matthew's been through so much.",30,"02x06 - Episode Six",323
"7439","matthew"," My dear, don't be too quick to decide. You never know. This might be a blessing in disguise.",30,"02x06 - Episode Six",324
"7440","isobel crawley"," What do you mean?",30,"02x06 - Episode Six",325
"7441","matthew"," Well, he seems a nice enough chap. He's not very pretty, of course, but he can walk 'round the estate on his own two legs and sire a string of sons to continue the line. All in all, I'd say that's a great improvement on the current situation. Sybil, could I prevail on you to take me back to my room?",30,"02x06 - Episode Six",326
"7442","lady sybil"," Of course.",30,"02x06 - Episode Six",327
"7443","cora, countess of grantham"," Oh, Mrs Hughes, we've had a letter in the evening post from Major Bryant's father. He must've found it hard to write for it seems the Major has been killed in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto.",31,"02x06 - Episode Six",328
"7444","mrs hughes"," How sad. I'm sorry to hear it.",31,"02x06 - Episode Six",329
"7445","cora, countess of grantham"," I know, and right at the end. But there we are. I'm afraid it's the end of our story, too.",31,"02x06 - Episode Six",330
"7446","miss o'brien"," What story is that, milady?",31,"02x06 - Episode Six",331
"7447","cora, countess of grantham"," A friend of Mrs Hughes knew the Major. Can you relay the news?",31,"02x06 - Episode Six",332
"7448","mrs hughes"," Of course. Will that be all?",31,"02x06 - Episode Six",333
"7449","cora, countess of grantham"," Yes, thank you.",31,"02x06 - Episode Six",334
"7450","miss o'brien"," Is that the Major Bryant that Ethel always thought so handsome, milady?",31,"02x06 - Episode Six",335
"7451","cora, countess of grantham"," Too handsome for anyone's good.",31,"02x06 - Episode Six",336
"7452","jane moorsum"," I... beg your parson, Your Lordship. I thought everyone had gone up.",32,"02x06 - Episode Six",337
"7453","robert, earl of grantham"," Not yet.",32,"02x06 - Episode Six",338
"7454","jane moorsum"," Is there anything I can fetch you?",32,"02x06 - Episode Six",339
"7455","robert, earl of grantham"," Nothing that would help. Never mind me. Goodnight.",32,"02x06 - Episode Six",340
"7456","lady edith"," Not a shock, exactly, but obviously it was a tremendous surprise.",33,"02x06 - Episode Six",341
"7457","patrick gordon"," So, what happens next?",33,"02x06 - Episode Six",342
"7458","lady edith"," Papa has sent your statement up to his solicitor.",33,"02x06 - Episode Six",343
"7459","lady edith"," What is it? Do you remember this place?",33,"02x06 - Episode Six",344
"7460","patrick gordon"," Of course I do.",33,"02x06 - Episode Six",345
"7461","lady edith"," How we used to hide over there",33,"02x06 - Episode Six",346
"7462","patrick gordon"," Wasn't there a governess none of you liked?",33,"02x06 - Episode Six",347
"7463","lady edith"," Fräulein Kelda.",33,"02x06 - Episode Six",348
"7464","patrick gordon"," That's it. (fake German) Fräulein Kelda!",33,"02x06 - Episode Six",349
"7465","patrick gordon"," What fun we used to make of her.",33,"02x06 - Episode Six",350
"7466","lady edith"," Do you know, I do recognise you now.",33,"02x06 - Episode Six",351
"7467","patrick gordon"," Do you?",33,"02x06 - Episode Six",352
"7468","patrick gordon"," You haven't changed at all. Not a jot. God knows I have.",33,"02x06 - Episode Six",353
"7469","lady edith"," It's not important.",33,"02x06 - Episode Six",354
"7470","patrick gordon"," Edith, if you really mean it, do you think, once it's all settled, we might talk again?",33,"02x06 - Episode Six",355
"7471","ethel"," But if they read her ladyship's letter, won't his parents know?",34,"02x06 - Episode Six",356
"7472","mrs hughes"," I don't think so. She only wrote to invite him to pay a visit. She thought the subject of the baby would come better face to face.",34,"02x06 - Episode Six",357
"7473","ethel"," Could I write to them?",34,"02x06 - Episode Six",358
"7474","mrs hughes"," You could try, but where's your proof? With him dead, you've no evidence at all.",34,"02x06 - Episode Six",359
"7475","ethel"," Then I'm ruined.",34,"02x06 - Episode Six",360
"7476","mrs hughes"," You were ruined already, my girl, so don't let's go overboard.",34,"02x06 - Episode Six",361

"7478","mrs hughes"," Very well, thank you. Why?",34,"02x06 - Episode Six",363
"7479","ethel"," Just thinking. Everyone wants to help her. To feed her, to find her work, because her son's father is dead. But so is the father of my son. Where's the difference?",34,"02x06 - Episode Six",364
"7480","mrs hughes"," The difference is, Jane is a respectable married woman that some man chose to be his wife.",34,"02x06 - Episode Six",365
"7481","ethel"," Is that enough?",34,"02x06 - Episode Six",366
"7482","mrs hughes"," It is in the real world.",34,"02x06 - Episode Six",367
"7483","sir richard carlisle"," Carson, I wonder if I could be put on the London train at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.",35,"02x06 - Episode Six",368
"7484","mr carson"," His Lordship's valet is catching that one. Would you object to his riding in the front with the chauffeur?",35,"02x06 - Episode Six",369
"7485","sir richard carlisle"," Not at all. Er, meanwhile, have you given my proposition any thought?",35,"02x06 - Episode Six",370
"7486","mr carson"," A great deal, Sir Richard.",35,"02x06 - Episode Six",371
"7487","sir richard carlisle"," I'll be back on the night of the tenth. Perhaps you could let me have your answer then.",35,"02x06 - Episode Six",372
"7488","lady mary"," Answer to what?",35,"02x06 - Episode Six",373
"7489","sir richard carlisle"," As to whether Carson will be captain of our ship.",35,"02x06 - Episode Six",374
"7490","lady mary"," With you at the helm, there's much more chance of a smooth crossing.",35,"02x06 - Episode Six",375
"7491","mr bates"," Your Lordship, I need to go to London tomorrow. I've spoken to Mr Carson, he has no objection.",36,"02x06 - Episode Six",376
"7492","robert, earl of grantham"," Please say this concerns property and not the former Mrs Bates.",36,"02x06 - Episode Six",377
"7493","mr bates"," I only wish she was the former, milord. Or better still, the late.",36,"02x06 - Episode Six",378
"7494","robert, earl of grantham"," Indeed?",36,"02x06 - Episode Six",379
"7495","mr bates"," I have to reason with her, I have no other choice. She's found a reason to delay things again. No, not delay. She's found a way to ruin things.",36,"02x06 - Episode Six",380
"7496","robert, earl of grantham"," Be sensible, Bates. Above all, do not lose your temper.",36,"02x06 - Episode Six",381
"7497","mr carson"," A German republic? No, I don't think so, Mr Branson. The Kaiser will go, I grant you, and maybe the Crown Prince, too, but there'll be a regency, mark my words. Monarchy is the lifeblood of Europe.",38,"02x06 - Episode Six",382
"7498","tom"," Sorry, Mr Carson, but I think you'll find the kings and emperors've had their day, if President Wilson has anything to say about it.",38,"02x06 - Episode Six",383

"7501","mr bates"," I don't know, but I know staying here won't make any difference.",38,"02x06 - Episode Six",386

"7503","mr bates"," I have business in London.",38,"02x06 - Episode Six",388
"7504","miss o'brien"," Oh, yes? Well, judging by your expression, your business doesn't seem to be prospering.",38,"02x06 - Episode Six",389

"7564","robert, earl of grantham"," There's more. There was a Peter Gordon who worked with Patrick at the foreign office. Now, he emigrated to Montreal in 1913.",43,"02x06 - Episode Six",449
"7565","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," When his face was blown away, he decided every cloud has a silver lining. He was perfectly placed to impersonate his dead friend.

"7573","robert, earl of grantham"," Murray will continue to investigate. So, Edith, can we be polite to the man, but nothing more? The end of the war should make it easier to unearth the evidence. That is all for the time being.",43,"02x06 - Episode Six",458

"7610","lavinia"," But, you see, it has. Because I've changed. When I was last here, I was so bowled over that I let you send me away. But not this time. I love you. I'm going to look after you, that's all there is to it.",47,"02x06 - Episode Six",495

"7630","lady edith"," ""It was too difficult. I'm sorry."" - P. Gordon.",50,"02x06 - Episode Six",515
"7631","lady sybil"," ""P"" for Patrick or ""P"" for Peter?",50,"02x06 - Episode Six",516

"7664","robert, earl of grantham"," Cora, Bates's wife has committed suicide. It's very sad, of course, but not, when I last looked, a reason to sack him.",3,"02x07 - Episode Seven",9
"7665","cora, countess of grantham"," They've taken the rest of the beds.",3,"02x07 - Episode Seven",10
"7666","robert, earl of grantham"," So, that's the finish of it.",3,"02x07 - Episode Seven",11

"7869","robert, earl of grantham"," Are you quite sure you won't regret it? I know how fond you are of Lady Mary.",20,"02x07 - Episode Seven",214

"7876","lavinia"," They won't be long. Oh, look. They've cleared the tea, but forgotten to take that tray.",22,"02x07 - Episode Seven",221
"7877","matthew"," Ring the bell.",22,"02x07 - Episode Seven",222
"7878","lavinia"," I'll do it. They'll be busy getting dinner ready.",22,"02x07 - Episode Seven",223

"7886","robert, earl of grantham"," Everyone come at once!",23,"02x07 - Episode Seven",231
"7887","lady mary"," What is it? What's happened?",23,"02x07 - Episode Seven",232
"7888","robert, earl of grantham"," Come and see this!",23,"02x07 - Episode Seven",233
"7889","robert, earl of grantham"," Is it true? Is it true what Lavinia says?",23,"02x07 - Episode Seven",234

"7891","cora, countess of grantham"," It's so wonderful!",23,"02x07 - Episode Seven",236
"7892","lady sybil"," It is, but don't tire yourself out. Sit down now and we'll send for Dr Clarkson.",23,"02x07 - Episode Seven",237
"7893","robert, earl of grantham"," She's right. Edith, go with Branson. Ge--get Clarkson, but fetch Mama and Cousin Isobel as well. I don't care what they're doing. Tell them to come now. My dear chap, I cannot begin to tell you what this means to me.",23,"02x07 - Episode Seven",238
"7894","matthew"," Well, it's pretty good news for me, too.",23,"02x07 - Episode Seven",239
"7895","dr clarkson"," There is only one possible explanation. It starts with my own mistake. Every indication told me that the spine was transected, which would have been incurable.",24,"02x07 - Episode Seven",240
"7896","robert, earl of grantham"," But when Sir John Coats came to see Matthew, he agreed with you.",24,"02x07 - Episode Seven",241
"7897","dr clarkson"," Well, he didn't, not entirely. He thought that it could conceivably be a case of spinal shock. That is, erm, intense bruising, which was sufficiently severe to impede the leg mechanism.",24,"02x07 - Episode Seven",242
"7898","lady mary"," But which would heal.",24,"02x07 - Episode Seven",243
"7899","lavinia"," Why didn't you tell us?",24,"02x07 - Episode Seven",244
"7900","dr clarkson"," Because I didn't agree with him, and I didn't want to raise Captain Crawley's hopes to no purpose.",24,"02x07 - Episode Seven",245
"7901","matthew"," I understand. And I don't blame you.",24,"02x07 - Episode Seven",246

"7903","matthew"," I know.",24,"02x07 - Episode Seven",248
"7904","dr clarkson"," And I'm afraid you will carry a bruise on your spine for the rest of your life.",24,"02x07 - Episode Seven",249

"7917","anna bates"," No, tell me. I've got time.",25,"02x07 - Episode Seven",262
"7918","mr bates"," It's just, something His Lordship said recently I can't get out of my mind. How Vera must have...bought the poison and taken it home with her.",25,"02x07 - Episode Seven",263
"7919","anna bates"," Yes, I suppose she must, and it's...it's just such a terrible thing to think of.",25,"02x07 - Episode Seven",264
"7920","mr bates"," But she didn't. I did.",25,"02x07 - Episode Seven",265
"7921","anna bates"," What?",25,"02x07 - Episode Seven",266
"7922","mr bates"," Months ago, before I left, Vera said we needed rat poison, and I bought it. It was arsenic, and I've been thinking that's what she must've taken.",25,"02x07 - Episode Seven",267

"7924","mr bates"," No.",25,"02x07 - Episode Seven",269
"7925","anna bates"," Tell them. If you don't, when they find out, it'll look bad.",25,"02x07 - Episode Seven",270
"7926","mr bates"," But wouldn't I be asking for trouble?",25,"02x07 - Episode Seven",271

"7932","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," Does that make for a happy atmosphere?",26,"02x07 - Episode Seven",277

"7940","isobel crawley"," Indeed.",26,"02x07 - Episode Seven",285

"7949","lavinia"," Are you sure? I know it should be at my home in London, but we've been through so much here.",26,"02x07 - Episode Seven",294

"7968","cora, countess of grantham"," No. But another time, please ask me before you agree to host a wedding.",29,"02x07 - Episode Seven",313

"7970","cora, countess of grantham"," I'm fond of Matthew, of course, but you do realise this means Mary's marriage will be delayed.",29,"02x07 - Episode Seven",315

"7994","mrs bryant"," How thoughtful.",31,"02x07 - Episode Seven",339
"7995","mr bryant"," But we can't be long. I've told our chauffeur to stay in the car.",31,"02x07 - Episode Seven",340
"7996","mrs hughes"," Will I take him something to eat?",31,"02x07 - Episode Seven",341
"7997","mr bryant"," Leave him be. He's quite happy.",31,"02x07 - Episode Seven",342

"8001","mrs hughes"," They're in the dining room now and they're getting straight into the car when they're finished. I tried to speak to her on her own, but there was never the right moment. (to the little boy) Your grandad is a bit of a bully.",32,"02x07 - Episode Seven",346
"8002","ethel"," But I must see them. I've come all this way.",32,"02x07 - Episode Seven",347
"8003","mrs hughes"," Of course it's a disappointment.",32,"02x07 - Episode Seven",348
"8004","ethel"," You said yourself there wouldn't be another chance.",32,"02x07 - Episode Seven",349
"8005","mrs hughes"," We can't know that. Maybe you should write to them after all. You've nothing to lose.",32,"02x07 - Episode Seven",350
"8006","ethel"," No. No, they have to see him. They must see Charlie.",32,"02x07 - Episode Seven",351

"8009","mrs patmore"," You wouldn't know how to start.",33,"02x07 - Episode Seven",354
"8010","daisy mason"," But you can tell me. And if I make it early, then you can make another if it's no good.",33,"02x07 - Episode Seven",355
"8011","mrs patmore"," Hmm. If I say yes, will you do as you're told?",33,"02x07 - Episode Seven",356
"8012","mrs hughes"," Daisy, there's a wretched chauffeur at the front who's not allowed to get out of the car. So, can you make him a sandwich and take him up a bottle of pop--",33,"02x07 - Episode Seven",357
"8013","daisy mason"," We've some ham.",33,"02x07 - Episode Seven",358
"8014","mrs hughes"," Oh, my God.",33,"02x07 - Episode Seven",359
"8015","daisy mason"," Who was that?",33,"02x07 - Episode Seven",360

"8017","daisy mason"," No.",33,"02x07 - Episode Seven",362
"8018","mrs patmore"," Then just...let's leave it at that.",33,"02x07 - Episode Seven",363
"8019","mrs bryant"," I'm afraid Downton will be a place of pilgrimage for a while.",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",364
"8020","cora, countess of grantham"," We're glad to be, if we can help to bring some peace of mind.",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",365

"8030","ethel"," What?",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",375
"8031","mr bryant"," I say, what proof have you? If my son was the father of this boy, where's your proof? Any letters? Any signed statement?",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",376
"8032","ethel"," Why would there be any letters? We were in the same house.",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",377
"8033","mrs hughes"," I think she's telling the truth.",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",378
"8034","mr bryant"," I'm not interested in ""think."" I want proof that my son acknowledged paternity of this boy. If what you say is true, then he would've known of the boy's existence for months before he...before he was killed.",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",379
"8035","ethel"," Yes, he knew.",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",380
"8036","mr bryant"," So, what did he do about it?",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",381
"8037","ethel"," Nothing. He did nothing.",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",382
"8038","mr bryant"," Thank you. That's the proof I was looking for. If Charles was the father, he would never have shirked his responsibilities. Never.",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",383
"8039","ethel"," Well, he did!",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",384
"8040","mr bryant"," I won't listen to any more slander!",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",385
"8041","mr bryant"," Now, will you please go and take that boy with you, whoever he is! You're upsetting Mrs Bryant!",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",386
"8042","mrs bryant"," Well, I would like--",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",387
"8043","mr bryant"," I said you are upsetting Mrs Bryant!",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",388
"8044","mr bryant"," Lord Grantham, are you going to stand by while this woman holds us to ransom?",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",389
"8045","robert, earl of grantham"," This isn't doing much good.",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",390
"8046","mrs hughes"," Ethel, you better come with me. Come on.",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",391
"8047","mr bryant"," She thinks we're a soft touch. They hear of a dead officer with some money behind them and suddenly there's a baby on every corner.",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",392
"8048","isobel crawley"," But if she's telling the truth--",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",393
"8049","mr bryant"," If Charles had fathered that boy, he would've told us. No, I'd say she's done her homework and discovered he was an only child. She thinks we'd be ripe for the plucking.",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",394
"8050","mrs bryant"," You knew her. Was she one of the nurses when he was here?",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",395
"8051","cora, countess of grantham"," She was a housemaid.",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",396

"8054","isobel crawley"," No one told me Major Bryant was your only son.",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",399
"8055","mrs bryant"," That's right. Just Charles.",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",400
"8056","isobel crawley"," Matthew is my only son, and he nearly died. I think I know a little of what you're going through.",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",401
"8057","mrs bryant"," He seems such a nice young man--",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",402
"8058","mr bryant"," Well, I think that's cast rather a shadow over the proceeding, so I don't see any point in prolonging it.",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",403
"8059","mr bryant"," Daphne, come on, we're leaving.",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",404
"8060","mrs bryant"," He's afraid of his own grief. That's why he behaves as he does. He's terrified of his own grief.",34,"02x07 - Episode Seven",405
"8061","ethel"," If that's what he's like, I don't want his help. I don't want it.",35,"02x07 - Episode Seven",406

"8109","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," Of course, I suspected long ago that the flame hadn't quite gone out. But then there was no chance of your recovery, and it seemed best to let her try for happiness where she could.",39,"02x07 - Episode Seven",454

"8117","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," I would just say one thing. Marriage is a long business. There's no getting out of it for our kind of people.

"8148","mr bates"," I said I was coming that evening, and I meant to have it out with her. Now, I may have said she was being unreasonable, but so she was.",41,"02x07 - Episode Seven",493
"8149","anna bates"," Will it change anything?",41,"02x07 - Episode Seven",494
"8150","mr bates"," Well, think about it. Before Vera's death, she had taken all my money and she had wrecked the divorce. Now as her widower, I inherit everything and we can marry whenever we like.",41,"02x07 - Episode Seven",495

"8602","mrs hughes"," He's a stout little chap, isn't he?",37,"02x08 - Episode Eight",366

"8617","mrs bryant"," That might be possi--",39,"02x08 - Episode Eight",381
"8618","mr bryant"," Of course she can't be his nurse. Just think for a minute. We mean to bring him up as a gentleman, send him to Harrow say and Oxford, and all the while his mother's down in the servants' hall? How does that work?",39,"02x08 - Episode Eight",382
"8619","ethel"," Well, I-- I could.",39,"02x08 - Episode Eight",383

"8621","mrs bryant"," Well, he has to know the truth sometime.",39,"02x08 - Episode Eight",385
"8622","mr bryant"," Maybe. But not for a long time. Till then, his father had a wartime marriage until he died, and his mother succumbed to Spanish flu.",39,"02x08 - Episode Eight",386

"8631","mrs hughes"," I think we've heard enough of that word for one day.",39,"02x08 - Episode Eight",395
"8632","mr bryant"," Very well. As the...nameless offshoot of a drudge. You're his mother. Which would you choose for him?",39,"02x08 - Episode Eight",396

"9967","cora, countess of grantham"," That's nice...if you mean it, Mama.",21,"03x02 - Episode Two",203
"9968","violet, dowager countess of grantham"," I do. It is marvellous the way our families support each other.",21,"03x02 - Episode Two",204

"10009","thomas"," Oi, what's this?",25,"03x02 - Episode Two",245
"10010","alfred nugent"," The stuff you gave me to clean the tails burned a hole in them.",25,"03x02 - Episode Two",246
"10011","thomas"," No such thing. I gave you some soda crystals, that's all. If you used them wrongly, it's not my fault. This is what comes of making him run before he could walk.",25,"03x02 - Episode Two",247
"10012","strallan"," If you want me to stay away from her, of course I will.",26,"03x02 - Episode Two",248
"10013","robert, earl of grantham"," I know it sounds harsh.",26,"03x02 - Episode Two",249
"10014","strallan"," Please, Robert, I understand completely. Lady Edith is your daughter and you don't want her involved with some cripple who's far too old.",26,"03x02 - Episode Two",250
"10015","robert, earl of grantham"," Now you're the one who's harsh.",26,"03x02 - Episode Two",251

"10027","robert, earl of grantham"," I was afraid you'd say that. So, what would you suggest?",28,"03x02 - Episode Two",263
"10028","thomas"," Ask Mr Molesley to join us. It'll be kinder to Alfred in the long run, kinder than asking more than he can give.",28,"03x02 - Episode Two",264
"10029","lady mary"," How is that poor footman? I thought Carson was going to eat him alive.",29,"03x02 - Episode Two",265

"10042","mrs hughes"," We're short of a footman. We're short of a kitchen maid and one house maid at least, that's if Anna's to be a proper lady's maid, which is what Lady Mary wants.",30,"03x02 - Episode Two",278
"10043","mr carson"," Well, naturally. She likes things done properly.",30,"03x02 - Episode Two",279

"10053","alfred nugent"," Has Mr Matthew complained?",31,"03x02 - Episode Two",289
"10054","mr carson"," He didn't have to. That's not your fault. We've hurried you along too fast. You mustn't feel badly.",31,"03x02 - Episode Two",290
"10055","miss o'brien"," This is Thomas's doing. But don't you fret. I'll make him sorry.",31,"03x02 - Episode Two",291

"10071","cora, countess of grantham"," I'm sorry, but quite enough of my father's money has already been poured into Downton. Why should Harold lose half his inheritance because of our folly?",34,"03x02 - Episode Two",307
